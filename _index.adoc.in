=== Brief

I usually read news/articles in HN (hacker news). And really excited and inspired by five-year-and-counting-collection by *Josh Branchaud* on GitHub.
And I also learn from another guy *Simon Willison* about his ideal on using github action with some script to create his own
TIL automatically. Then I asked myself that I do need this also. To track down what I learned day by day and also to keep
the TIL like dictionary for my work.
